1. Experimental details 

General. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz for 1H and 

100  MHz  for  13C)  spectrometer  in  d-DMSO,  CDCl3  and  C6D6  at  25  °C.  11B  NMR  spectra  were 

measured  with  a  Bruker  AV  III  HD-500  spectrometer  in  CDCl3  at  25  °C.  Chemical  shifts  are 

reported in  ppm using d-DMSO (2.50 ppm), CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) and C6H6 (7.16 ppm) for 1H NMR, 

as well as using d-DMSO (39.52 ppm), CDCl3 (77.16 ppm) and C6D6 (128.06 ppm) for 13C NMR. 

For 11B NMR, BF3•Et2O was used as an external standard. Elemental analysis was conducted on a 

VarioEL elemental analyzer. Thermal analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer 7 instrument at a 

heating  rate  of  10  °C  min–1  under  nitrogen  flow.  Absorption  spectra  were  measured  with  a 

Shimadzu  UV-3600  spectrometer  using  spectral  grade  solvents.  Cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  was 

performed on an CHI660a electrochemical workstation using Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M) as electrolyte at a 

scan rate of 50 mV s–1. The CV cell has a glassy carbon electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a 

standard calomel reference electrode. The measurement was carried out under an argon atmosphene 

in  CH2Cl2 (0.4 mM). The redox potentials were  calibrated  with  ferrocene as an internal  standard. 

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) 

energy levels  were  calculated based on  the equations: EHOMO/ELUMO = –(4.80 +  Epa

ox1/E1/2

red1) eV. 

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed with a SPA300HV (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Japan) 

in tapping mode. Polarized optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were performed 

using  Carl  Zeiss  Microlmaging  GmbH  Axio  Imager  A2m  and  XL-30  ESEM  FEG  Scanning 

Electron  Microscope  FEI  COMPANYTM,  respectively.  Transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM) 

and  selected-area  electron  diffraction  (SEAD)  were  performed  using  a  JEOL  JEM-1011 

transmission  electron  microscope  operated  at  100  kV.  The  grazing  incidence  X-ray  diffraction 

(GI-XRD) data was obtained on a Bruker D8 Discover reflector (Cu Kα, λ = 1.54056 Å) under 40 

kV  and  40  mA  tube  current.  The  scanning  speed  is  3  s  per  step  with  0.1°  step  size  (2θ).  The 

measurements were conducted in a scanning interval of 2θ between 2° and 30°.   

Materials  and  reagents.  All  reactions  were  performed  under  an  argon  atmosphere,  unless 

stated  otherwise.  Commercially  available  solvents  and  reagents  were  used  without  further 

purification  unless  otherwise  mentioned.  Dry  toluene  and  CH2Cl2  were  distilled  via  standard 

methods.

3. Thermal properties   

Thermogravimetric  analysis  (TGA)  measurements  indicate  that  the  thermal  decomposition 

temperature (Td) at 5%  weight loss  is 250  oC for 5a  and  306  oC for 5b,  respectively. 5b shows a 

weight  loss of 7.8% at  313  oC in  TGA  curve,  which is  ascribed to  the  release of two  BF2 groups 

(theoretical value: 8.0%).

4. Geometry optimizations 

The  geometry  optimizations  of  5a-Me  and  5b-Me,  as  well  as  5a-CC  and  5b-CC  were 

performed  using  Gaussian  09  program  at  the  B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)  level  of  theory.1  5a-Me  and 

5b-Me  are  the  model  compounds  of  5a  and  5b  with  methyl  group  replacing  isooctyl  chain.  The 

C−C-containing polyarenes 5a-CC and 5b-CC are the analogues of 5a and 5b, which use the four 

C−C covalent bonds to replace the B←N units.

B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) 

level  of 

theory.  The  B←N-containing  polyarenes  exhibit 

the  curved 

configurations, whereas  the C−C-containing polyarenes show the fully planar configurations.  It  is 

suggested  that  the  overcrowded  B←N  units  can  significantly  impact  on  the  molecular 

configurations.

6. Theoretical calculations 

Density  functional  theory  (DFT)  calculations  at  the  B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)  level  of  theory  were 

performed on 5a-Me, 5b-Me, 5a-CC and 5b-CC. To assign the absorption bands observed in the 

UV/Vis  spectra  of  5a  and  5b,  time-dependent  DFT  calculations  were  performed  on  5a-Me  and 

5b-Me using Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory.

        After replacing the C−C bonds by the B←N units, the electronic energy levels of conjugated 

polyarenes,  especially  the  LUMO  levels,  are  significantly  decreased.  Moreover,  while  the 

π-frameworks  in  5a-CC  and  5b-CC  are  electronically  negative,  the  π-frameworks  in  5a-Me  and 

5b-Me  are  electronically  positive.  These  results  demonstrate  the  electron-withdrawing  B←N  unit 

can significantly enhance the electron affinity of π-systems.

        To further demonstrate the high electron affinity of QBNA, we compare its LUMO level with 

those  of  the  reported  high-performance  n-type  organic  semiconductors.  The  experimental  LUMO 

levels are calculated based on ELUMO = –(4.80 + E1/2

red1) eV. As shown in Figure S13, the ELUMO of 

these  n-type  organic  semiconductors  are  ca.  −4.2~−4.5  eV,  which  are  quite  comparable  to  that 

(−4.58  eV)  of  QBNA.  These  comparisons  clearly  verify  the  extremely  high  electron  affinity  of 

quadruply B←N-fused dibenzo-azaacene.

7. SC-OFET device fabrications and characterizations 

        Single-crystal organic field-effect transistors (SC-OFETs) were fabricated with a bottom-gate/ 

top-contact  (BGTC)  configuration.  The  substrates  with  silicon  wafer  covered  with  300  nm  SiO2 

were  cleaned  with  double-distilled  water,  piranha  solution  (H2SO4:H2O2  =  7:3),  double-distilled 

water,  and  isopropanol  and  then  dried  under  a  high-purity  nitrogen  flow.  The  modification  of 

SiO2/Si  wafers  was  carried  out  using  octadecyltrichlorosilane  (OTS)  with  the  vapor-deposition 

method:  the  cleaned  wafers  were  cleaned  with  oxygen  plasma  (10  min,  100W),  then  were  dried 

under vacuum at 90 °C for 1.5 h. After decreasing the temperature to 60 °C, a small drop of OTS 

was dropped onto the SiO2/Si wafers. This system was then heated at 120 °C for 2 h under vacuum. 

The OTS modified SiO2/Si wafers were cleaned with n-hexane, chloroform and isopropyl alcohol, 

and finally were dried with high-purity nitrogen flow.   

        Single-crystal  microwires  of  QBNA  were  prepared  in  typical  growth  conditions  through 

drop-casting of its toluene solution (1 mg/mL) onto the OTS modified SiO2/Si substrates in a sealed 

bottle  at  25  °C.  Single-crystal  microwires  gradually  appeared  on  the  substrates  with  the  solution 

evaporation. Then the SC-OFET devices were fabricated with the organic ribbon mask method. An 

individual  micrometer  organic  nanowire  made  in  advance  was  first  put  on  a  microwire 

perpendicularly  to  the  growth  direction  under  a  high-resolution  microscopy  (magnification  at 

x400−1000). A layer of 20 nm Au was then deposited on the masked microwire as the source and 

drain electrodes. Finally, the organic nanowires were removed and a device with two electrodes was 

obtained.  All  electrical  characteristics  of  the  devices  were  measured  at  room  temperature  in  air 

using a semiconductor parameter analyser (Keithley 4200 SCS) and a micromanipulator 6150 probe 

station.  The  mobility  was  extracted  from  the  saturation  region  by  using  the  equation  of  IDS  = 

(W/2L)Ciμ(VG−VT)2,  where  IDS  is  the  drain-source  current,  μ  is  the  field-effect  mobility,  Ci  is  the 

capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer,  VG and VT are the gate voltage and threshold 

voltage, L and W are the channel length and width basing on an individual microwire in SC-OFET 

devices, respectively.

        We  have  optimized  the  device  fabrication  conditions  of  5b.  The  solutions  of  5b  in  toluene, 

o-xylene,  CHCl3  and  chlorobenzene  were  used  to  grow  its  micrometer-sized  single  crystals.  We 

could  obtain  some  single-crystal  microwires  that  are  suitable  for  SC-OFETs  from  its  toluene  and 

o-xylene solutions. As shown in Figure S15, the SC-OFET device based on the microwires from the 

solution of 5b in o-xylene exhibits the unipolar n-type behavior with an electron mobility of 1.25 

cm2 V–1 s–1, an on/off current ratio of 105−106 and a threshold voltage of 21 V.
