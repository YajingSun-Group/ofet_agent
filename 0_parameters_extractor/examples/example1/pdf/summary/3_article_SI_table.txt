■ INTRODUCTION

A fundamental characteristic of π-electron systems and π-
conjugated materials is electron aﬃnity.1 High electron aﬃnity,
which is generally characterized by low-lying LUMO energy
leads to various intriguing properties of π-
level (ELUMO),
systems, such as easy electron injection, stable electron
transport, strong electron acceptor, and facilitated n-type
doping.2 Therefore, π-systems with high electron aﬃnity have
drawn much attention in both synthetic chemistry and organic
electronic materials. The general strategy to design molecules
with high electron aﬃnity is to incorporate the electron-
withdrawing units, such as imide unit, halogen atoms (Cl and
F), cyano group, and sp2-hybridized N atom (Figure 1a).3
However, as π-systems are intrinsically electron-rich,
is
challenging to develop π-conjugated molecules with extremely
high electron aﬃnity (low ELUMO).

A particular application of π-conjugated molecules with high
electron aﬃnity is as n-type semiconductors in organic ﬁeld-
eﬀect transistors (OFETs).4 High electron aﬃnity of n-type
organic semiconductors (ELUMO < ca. −4.0 eV) can enable
eﬃcient electron injection and good ambient stability of
OFETs. Integrating multiple electron-withdrawing units onto
large π-frameworks has been proved to be eﬃcient to produce
high-performance n-type organic semiconductors.5 However, it

thiophenes, as well as their derivatives, etc.6 New n-type
organic semiconductors with excellent OFET device perform-
ance thus remain important and attractive.

Boron atom has one less electron than carbon atom and has
a typical empty p-orbital. This feature characterizes boron
species as electron-deﬁcient scaﬀolds that can induce intriguing
optoelectronic properties of organoboron compounds,7 such as
two-photon absorption, near-infrared light absorption, ther-
mally activated delayed ﬂuorescence, etc.8 For many years,
incorporating B atoms into π-systems is expected to be an
eﬀective approach to accomplish high electron aﬃnity and high
electron mobility.7,9 However, B-containing π-conjugated
molecules seldom show adequately high electron aﬃnity and
their ELUMO are usually higher than −4.0 eV. B-containing π-
conjugated molecules also display unsatisfactory electron-
transporting properties. Their electron mobilities are usually
less than 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.10 Boron species can coordinate
with N-heteroaromatic rings to form boron−nitrogen coordi-
nation bond (B←N), which has led to various organic
semiconductors and light-emitting materials.11 Very recently,
we developed a dibenzo-azaacene containing two B←N units,
which shows a low-lying ELUMO of −3.87 eV and a decent
electron mobility of 0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1.12 This study thus
convinces us that B←N unit is a promising candidate to design
π-conjugated molecules with high electron aﬃnity and high
electron mobility (Figure 1a).

In this work, we experimentally prove the remarkably high
electron aﬃnity and high electron mobility of organoboron
compounds. This is realized by incorporating multiple B←N
units into azaacene to design quadruply B←N-fused dibenzo-
four B←N units
azaacene (QBNA). The incorporation of
greatly changes the electronic structures and properties and
signiﬁcantly downshifts the electronic energy levels of QBNA.
QBNA shows an ultralow ELUMO of −4.58 eV, which is among
the lowest for n-type organic semiconductors. The single-
crystal OFET (SC-OFET) devices based on QBNA display
unipolar n-type characteristic with an electron mobility of up
to 1.60 cm2 V−1 s−1 and excellent ambient stability. To the best
of our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst organoboron molecule
with electron mobility higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Our synthetic strategy of the B←N-containing polyarenes is to
perform a one-pot multifold borylation cyclization on the tetra-
alkylaminated dibenzo-azaacenes. Scheme 1 illustrates the
synthetic route of QBNA (5b) and its analog 5a, which have
eight and six linearly annelated rings, respectively. In the ﬁrst
step, oxidization of 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene 1 using the
conventional oxidization conditions
for pyrene and its
derivatives could lead only to the partially oxidized products.13
·xH2O as the
So we improved the condition with NaIO4/RuCl3
oxidant system and CH3CN/H2O as the solvent at a high
reaction temperature of 120 °C, successfully producing the
fully oxidized compound 2 in 58% yield. Condensation of 2
with benzene-1,2-diamine/naphthalene-2,3-diamine and then
alkylamination of 3a/3b produced the key precursors 4a/4b,
respectively. The moderate yields of the alkylamination step
are due to the low solubility of 3a/3b. Finally, the borylation
·Et2O/Et3N aﬀorded 5a/5b in good
reaction of 4a/4b with BF3
yields, and in this step four B←N-fused six-membered rings are
these B←N-containing
simultaneously formed. Notably,
polyarenes 5a and 5b are stable enough to be puriﬁed by
silica gel column chromatography. They also show excellent
light and oxygen stability as determined by the repeated
photophysical measurements under ambient conditions in
which no spectral change is observed. In addition, 5a and 5b
are both well soluble in common organic solvents, such as
chloroform, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran.

The structures of 5a and 5b were unambiguously conﬁrmed
by various NMR spectroscopies, high-resolution mass spec-
trometry, and elemental analysis (see Supporting Information).
The 11B NMR spectra exhibit only one signal at ca. 2.3 ppm
(Figure S1). This is consistent with those for the organoboron
compounds with boron atoms linked to two ﬂuorines and two
the four B←N units on the
nitrogens and suggests that
frameworks exist in the same manner.14 In the 1H NMR
spectrum of 5b, four diﬀerent signals observed in the aromatic
region reveal its 4-fold symmetric structure in solution. To
assign Ha, Hb, and Hc
in the backbone of 5b, we also
performed the 1H−1H COSY and 1D NOE measurements. In
the 1H−1H COSY spectrum (Figure 2a),
the correlation
between Ha and Hb and no correlation of Hc (δ = 9.58 ppm,
singlet) with others reveal that Hc is the proton adjacent to the
B←N-linked ring. Two correlative signals in the 1D NOE

To gain insight into the conﬁgurations of 5a and 5b, we
performed structural optimizations on the model compounds
with methyl groups (5a-Me and 5b-Me) using density
functional theory (DFT) calculations (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)).

adopt curved conﬁgurations along the azaacene skeletons with
the dihedral angles of 23.4° and 25.4°, respectively. These
curved conﬁgurations are in stark contrast
to the planar
conﬁgurations of the previously reported dibenzo-azaacenes
containing two B←N units.12 This is attributed to the
incorporation of multiple B←N units in 5a and 5b, which
results in large fused-ring strain of B←N-heterocycles and thus
distorts the whole π-skeleton for strain relaxation. It is notable
that this curved structure has no negative eﬀects on molecular
crystallinity. 5b displays excellent crystallinity, which is
beneﬁcial
for electron transport (vide infra). Recently,
nonplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have
attracted great attention of synthesis chemists.16 The general
approach to design nonplanar PAH molecules is to incorporate
non-six-membered rings or steric hindrance into π-skeletons.

685 nm and a detectable weak band at 800 nm. 5b exhibits two
strong peaks at 783/712 nm and one weak band at 880 nm
(Table 1 and Figure S5). Compared to that of 5a,
the
absorption spectrum of 5b is red-shifted by ca. 40 nm because
of its extended π-conjugation. Electron-deﬁcient polyarenes
with large π-skeletons mostly exhibit the absorption maxima in
the visible region. For example, a C64 nanographene containing
four imides reported by Würthner and co-workers shows the
λ
abs of 584 nm.18a A N-doped graphene nanoribbon with 7.7
nm in length reported by Mateo-Alonso and co-workers
exhibits the λ
abs of 605 nm.18b In contrast, 5a and 5b
containing four B←N units show the absorption peaks in the
near-infrared (NIR) region. Moreover, the molar absorption
coeﬃcients of 5a and 5b are both as high as exceeding 1 × 105
M−1 cm−1. The toluene solutions of 5a and 5b exhibit the
green and yellowish green colors, respectively.

To elucidate these characteristic absorption bands, we
conducted time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations on
5a-Me and 5b-Me at
the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level (see
Supporting Information). The calculation results are shown
in Figure 5. For 5a, while the weak absorption band at around

800 nm is assigned to the electronic transition of HOMO-1 →
LUMO, the maximum absorption band at 600−800 nm is
assigned to the HOMO → LUMO and HOMO-3 → LUMO
+2 transitions. For 5b, the weak absorption band at ca. 880 nm
is attributed to the HOMO-4 → LUMO and HOMO-2 →
LUMO transitions and the maximum absorption band is
assigned to the HOMO-1 → LUMO transition. The
absorption properties of 5a and 5b are well reproduced by
the TD-DFT calculations. Accordingly, the weak absorption
bands in the long-wavelength region of 5a and 5b are both
attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)
transitions within π-frameworks accompanying small oscillator
strengths (Figures S8 and S9). In addition, the absorption
bands of 5a and 5b all involve their LUMOs. The LUMOs of
5a and 5b both are localized on the linear azaacene skeletons
and the LUMO energy levels are very low (ca. −4.0 eV). These
characteristics are totally diﬀerent from those of the all-carbon
analogous compounds (Figure S10). It is suggested that the
four B←N units greatly perturb the electronic structures of π-
skeletons, thus contributing to the NIR absorption properties
of 5a and 5b.

To evaluate their electron aﬃnity, we performed cyclic
voltammetry measurements on 5a and 5b in CH2Cl2 using n-
Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M) as supporting electrolyte. As shown in
Figure 6, both of them exhibit three well-deﬁned reversible

and 5b. The ELUMO and EHOMO are −4.45/−5.94 eV for 5a and
−4.58/−5.95 eV for 5b, respectively. The ultralow ELUMO of 5a
and 5b experimentally prove their extremely high electron
aﬃnity. The variations in energy levels from 5a to 5b are fully
consistent with the theoretical calculation results (Figure S11).
Low ELUMO is necessary for eﬃcient electron injection and
transport of n-type organic semiconductors in OFETs.4,5 The

extremely low ELUMO of ca. −4.5 eV of 5a and 5b are rarely
achieved for B-containing π-systems. Only a few organoboron
compounds show very low ELUMO, which are mostly based on
boron-dipyrromethene (BPDIPY), such as quinodimethane
bridged BODIPY dimers and BF 2-containing bis-
(pyrrolopyrrole) cyanines.19 Compared to the reported
dibenzo-azaacenes containing two B←N units, 5a and 5b
containing four B←N units exhibit the lower ELUMO by ca. 0.7
eV.12 The extra two B←N units further lead to the large
downshifts of the ELUMO of π-systems. Moreover, the ELUMO of
5a and 5b are among the lowest for the reported high-
performance n-type organic semiconductors (Figure S13).5
Therefore, the incorporation of multiple B←N units is an
eﬃcient strategy to signiﬁcantly enhance electron aﬃnity of the
π-system.

Another interesting aspect is the crystalline property of 5b.
these B←N-
In our attempt
to grow single crystals of
containing polyarenes in solution for X-ray structural analysis,
we could obtain some micrometer-sized wires of 5b. On the
basis of this phenomenon, we prepared the microstructures of
5b on the substrate via a solvent evaporation method. The
solution of 5b in toluene (1 mg/mL) was drop-casted on the
octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-treated SiO2/Si substrate in a
sealed Petri dish. After evaporation of
the solvent, some
microstructures appeared on the substrate. The polarized
optical microscopy (POM) images in Figure 7a show that
microwires with the length of around 20 μm are formed. When
the substrate is rotated by 45°, these microwires exhibit the
obvious color change from bright to dark,
indicating the
crystalline character of 5b. As shown in Figure 7b, the atomic
force microscopy (AFM) image of a typical microwire reveals a
smooth surface with the thickness of around 36 nm.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area
electron diﬀraction (SAED) were used to further assess the
crystalline property of 5b. As shown in Figure 7c, the bright
and well-deﬁned diﬀractions as well as no change of the SAED
patterns at diﬀerent regions of an individual microwire prove
the single-crystal nature of the whole wire, demonstrating the
good crystallinity of 5b. According to the SAED diﬀraction
patterns, a repeating unit of 7.2 Å along the crystal growth
direction is observed. This value is much smaller than that of
the molecular width and length, indicating that the molecular
packing orientation of 5b is probably along the crystal growth
direction. The good crystallinity of 5b may be correlated to its
large π-framework without any steric hindrance at
the
periphery.

To investigate the electron-transporting properties of these
B←N-containing polyarenes, we fabricated the OFET devices
based on the single-crystal microwires of 5b. The SC-OFET
devices with a bottom-gate/top-contact (BG/TC) conﬁgu-
ration were fabricated using the “organic ribbon mask”
method.20 Gold source and drain electrodes were deposited
on an individual microwire via thermal evaporation (Figure
7d). The optical microscopy image of one typical device is

shown in the inset of Figure 7e. The transfer and output
characteristics of
the device measured under ambient
conditions are provided in Figure 7e and Figure S15. The
SC-OFET device exhibits the unipolar n-type behavior. A
highest electron mobility of 1.60 cm2 V−1 s−1 (average of 20
devices: 1.03 ± 0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1) with an on/oﬀ current ratio
of 105−106 and a threshold voltage of 14 V was obtained
(Figure S16). Furthermore, the excellent ambient stability of
the SC-OFET device of 5b was demonstrated. Figure 7f shows
the typical curves of performance versus storage time. Less
than 5% degradation in electron mobility was observed after
storing the device in air for 10 days. Therefore, the electron-
transporting properties of 5b are greatly improved in
comparison to those of
the reported dibenzo-azaacene
containing two B←N units. It is ascribed to the signiﬁcantly
enhanced electron aﬃnity and good crystallinity of 5b, which
facilitate electron injection and transport and improve air
stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time
that electron mobility higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained
for organoboron compounds. B←N-containing polyarenes
thus represent a new kind of high-performance n-type organic
semiconductors.

■ CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have synthesized two π-conjugated
polyarenes incorporated with four B←N units through one-
pot multifold borylation cyclization reaction. The incorpo-
ration of multiple B←N units signiﬁcantly impacts their
electronic structures and properties. QBNA has a LUMO
energy level as low as −4.58 eV, illustrating its remarkably high
electron aﬃnity. Moreover, QBNA shows good crystallinity
despite its curved conﬁguration. The SC-OFET devices based
on QBNA display unipolar n-type behavior with an electron
mobility of 1.60 cm2 V−1 s−1 and excellent ambient stability.
This study thus experimentally proves the high electron aﬃnity
and high electron mobility of organoboron compounds.
Furthermore, this study provides a design strategy for π-
systems with high electron aﬃnity based on organoboron

chemistry, which can be applied to the construction of other
electronic materials.

100  MHz  for  13C)  spectrometer  in  d-DMSO,  CDCl3  and  C6D6  at  25  °C.  11B  NMR  spectra  were 

measured  with  a  Bruker  AV  III  HD-500  spectrometer  in  CDCl3  at  25  °C.  Chemical  shifts  are 

reported in  ppm using d-DMSO (2.50 ppm), CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) and C6H6 (7.16 ppm) for 1H NMR, 

as well as using d-DMSO (39.52 ppm), CDCl3 (77.16 ppm) and C6D6 (128.06 ppm) for 13C NMR. 

For 11B NMR, BF3•Et2O was used as an external standard. Elemental analysis was conducted on a 

VarioEL elemental analyzer. Thermal analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer 7 instrument at a 

heating  rate  of  10  °C  min–1  under  nitrogen  flow.  Absorption  spectra  were  measured  with  a 

Shimadzu  UV-3600  spectrometer  using  spectral  grade  solvents.  Cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  was 

performed on an CHI660a electrochemical workstation using Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M) as electrolyte at a 

scan rate of 50 mV s–1. The CV cell has a glassy carbon electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a 

standard calomel reference electrode. The measurement was carried out under an argon atmosphene 

in  CH2Cl2 (0.4 mM). The redox potentials were  calibrated  with  ferrocene as an internal  standard. 

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) 

energy levels  were  calculated based on  the equations: EHOMO/ELUMO = –(4.80 +  Epa

ox1/E1/2

red1) eV. 

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed with a SPA300HV (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Japan) 

in tapping mode. Polarized optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were performed 

using  Carl  Zeiss  Microlmaging  GmbH  Axio  Imager  A2m  and  XL-30  ESEM  FEG  Scanning 

Electron  Microscope  FEI  COMPANYTM,  respectively.  Transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM) 

and  selected-area  electron  diffraction  (SEAD)  were  performed  using  a  JEOL  JEM-1011 

transmission  electron  microscope  operated  at  100  kV.  The  grazing  incidence  X-ray  diffraction 

(GI-XRD) data was obtained on a Bruker D8 Discover reflector (Cu Kα, λ = 1.54056 Å) under 40 

kV  and  40  mA  tube  current.  The  scanning  speed  is  3  s  per  step  with  0.1°  step  size  (2θ).  The 

measurements were conducted in a scanning interval of 2θ between 2° and 30°.   

Materials  and  reagents.  All  reactions  were  performed  under  an  argon  atmosphere,  unless 

stated  otherwise.  Commercially  available  solvents  and  reagents  were  used  without  further 

purification  unless  otherwise  mentioned.  Dry  toluene  and  CH2Cl2  were  distilled  via  standard 

methods.

3. Thermal properties   

Thermogravimetric  analysis  (TGA)  measurements  indicate  that  the  thermal  decomposition 

temperature (Td) at 5%  weight loss  is 250  oC for 5a  and  306  oC for 5b,  respectively. 5b shows a 

weight  loss of 7.8% at  313  oC in  TGA  curve,  which is  ascribed to  the  release of two  BF2 groups 

(theoretical value: 8.0%).

4. Geometry optimizations 

The  geometry  optimizations  of  5a-Me  and  5b-Me,  as  well  as  5a-CC  and  5b-CC  were 

performed  using  Gaussian  09  program  at  the  B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)  level  of  theory.1  5a-Me  and 

5b-Me  are  the  model  compounds  of  5a  and  5b  with  methyl  group  replacing  isooctyl  chain.  The 

C−C-containing polyarenes 5a-CC and 5b-CC are the analogues of 5a and 5b, which use the four 

C−C covalent bonds to replace the B←N units.

B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) 

level  of 

theory.  The  B←N-containing  polyarenes  exhibit 

the  curved 

configurations, whereas  the C−C-containing polyarenes show the fully planar configurations.  It  is 

suggested  that  the  overcrowded  B←N  units  can  significantly  impact  on  the  molecular 

configurations.

6. Theoretical calculations 

Density  functional  theory  (DFT)  calculations  at  the  B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)  level  of  theory  were 

performed on 5a-Me, 5b-Me, 5a-CC and 5b-CC. To assign the absorption bands observed in the 

UV/Vis  spectra  of  5a  and  5b,  time-dependent  DFT  calculations  were  performed  on  5a-Me  and 

5b-Me using Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory.

        After replacing the C−C bonds by the B←N units, the electronic energy levels of conjugated 

polyarenes,  especially  the  LUMO  levels,  are  significantly  decreased.  Moreover,  while  the 

π-frameworks  in  5a-CC  and  5b-CC  are  electronically  negative,  the  π-frameworks  in  5a-Me  and 

5b-Me  are  electronically  positive.  These  results  demonstrate  the  electron-withdrawing  B←N  unit 

can significantly enhance the electron affinity of π-systems.

        To further demonstrate the high electron affinity of QBNA, we compare its LUMO level with 

those  of  the  reported  high-performance  n-type  organic  semiconductors.  The  experimental  LUMO 

levels are calculated based on ELUMO = –(4.80 + E1/2

red1) eV. As shown in Figure S13, the ELUMO of 

these  n-type  organic  semiconductors  are  ca.  −4.2~−4.5  eV,  which  are  quite  comparable  to  that 

(−4.58  eV)  of  QBNA.  These  comparisons  clearly  verify  the  extremely  high  electron  affinity  of 

quadruply B←N-fused dibenzo-azaacene.

7. SC-OFET device fabrications and characterizations 

        Single-crystal organic field-effect transistors (SC-OFETs) were fabricated with a bottom-gate/ 

top-contact  (BGTC)  configuration.  The  substrates  with  silicon  wafer  covered  with  300  nm  SiO2 

were  cleaned  with  double-distilled  water,  piranha  solution  (H2SO4:H2O2  =  7:3),  double-distilled 

water,  and  isopropanol  and  then  dried  under  a  high-purity  nitrogen  flow.  The  modification  of 

SiO2/Si  wafers  was  carried  out  using  octadecyltrichlorosilane  (OTS)  with  the  vapor-deposition 

method:  the  cleaned  wafers  were  cleaned  with  oxygen  plasma  (10  min,  100W),  then  were  dried 

under vacuum at 90 °C for 1.5 h. After decreasing the temperature to 60 °C, a small drop of OTS 

was dropped onto the SiO2/Si wafers. This system was then heated at 120 °C for 2 h under vacuum. 

The OTS modified SiO2/Si wafers were cleaned with n-hexane, chloroform and isopropyl alcohol, 

and finally were dried with high-purity nitrogen flow.   

        Single-crystal  microwires  of  QBNA  were  prepared  in  typical  growth  conditions  through 

drop-casting of its toluene solution (1 mg/mL) onto the OTS modified SiO2/Si substrates in a sealed 

bottle  at  25  °C.  Single-crystal  microwires  gradually  appeared  on  the  substrates  with  the  solution 

evaporation. Then the SC-OFET devices were fabricated with the organic ribbon mask method. An 

individual  micrometer  organic  nanowire  made  in  advance  was  first  put  on  a  microwire 

perpendicularly  to  the  growth  direction  under  a  high-resolution  microscopy  (magnification  at 

x400−1000). A layer of 20 nm Au was then deposited on the masked microwire as the source and 

drain electrodes. Finally, the organic nanowires were removed and a device with two electrodes was 

obtained.  All  electrical  characteristics  of  the  devices  were  measured  at  room  temperature  in  air 

using a semiconductor parameter analyser (Keithley 4200 SCS) and a micromanipulator 6150 probe 

station.  The  mobility  was  extracted  from  the  saturation  region  by  using  the  equation  of  IDS  = 

(W/2L)Ciμ(VG−VT)2,  where  IDS  is  the  drain-source  current,  μ  is  the  field-effect  mobility,  Ci  is  the 

capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer,  VG and VT are the gate voltage and threshold 

voltage, L and W are the channel length and width basing on an individual microwire in SC-OFET 

devices, respectively.

        We  have  optimized  the  device  fabrication  conditions  of  5b.  The  solutions  of  5b  in  toluene, 

o-xylene,  CHCl3  and  chlorobenzene  were  used  to  grow  its  micrometer-sized  single  crystals.  We 

could  obtain  some  single-crystal  microwires  that  are  suitable  for  SC-OFETs  from  its  toluene  and 

o-xylene solutions. As shown in Figure S15, the SC-OFET device based on the microwires from the 

solution of 5b in o-xylene exhibits the unipolar n-type behavior with an electron mobility of 1.25 

cm2 V–1 s–1, an on/off current ratio of 105−106 and a threshold voltage of 21 V.
