An artificial intelligence agent for enhancing organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) performance by combining GPT-4 with advanced machine learning algorithms is presented. It efficiently extracts OFET experimental data from extensive literature and gives intelligent suggestions for OFET fabrication. 

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YajingSun-Group/ofet_agent.git
cd ofet_agent

conda create -n ofet_agent python=3.10

```
